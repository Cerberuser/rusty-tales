    <h3>What's the cost of Zero-Cost Abstractions?</h3>

        <p>This place is hosting several stories I've managed to catch involving Rust. Basically, they're just a short lookups into fantasy world, where our technology (and programming) is treated like magic; for ones who don't want to think about IT, I'll try to make this simple and exciting as an adventure. But if you're interested in Rust and want to know how to think in it (like, you know, studying the foreign language), I hope you'll be able to easily find something usual too; and to clarify all this, I'll make a technical counterpart for any of the stories.</p>
